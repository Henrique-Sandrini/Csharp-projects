# C# Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of C# console applications developed for learning and academic purposes.  
The projects range from introductory language practice to a more advanced application focused on object-oriented programming concepts.

Each folder represents an independent project with a specific learning objective.

## Repository Overview

### xadrez-console

A complete console-based chess game developed as an advanced programming project.

This application was designed to apply and integrate core and advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including:

- Class hierarchies and inheritance
- Polymorphism through piece behavior
- Encapsulation of game rules and board logic
- Abstraction of shared behaviors
- Exception handling for rule enforcement and invalid actions
- Separation of responsibilities across namespaces and classes

The project simulates a full chess match in the terminal, enforcing the official rules of the game and managing turns, captures, check, and checkmate conditions.

This folder represents the most complex and advanced project in the repository.

### Products

A console application developed as a language training exercise.

This project focuses on practicing fundamental C# concepts, such as:

- Classes and objects
- Properties and methods
- Basic control structures
- Console input and output
- Data validation

The goal of this project is to strengthen understanding of C# syntax and core language features.

### StaticMembers

A training project focused on the use of static members in C#.

This application explores concepts such as:

- Static attributes and methods
- Class-level behavior
- Shared state management
- Best practices for static member usage

It serves as a practical exercise to understand when and how static members should be used in C# applications.
